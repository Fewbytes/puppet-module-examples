======================

This is an example repo for puppet modules to be imported for use in cloudify.

The use-case that these modules were prepared for is deployment from git of a Ruby-on-Rails webapp with mysql behind an apache reverse proxy. Tested by deploying redmine 1.4.5 on ubuntu, but should work with slight modifications for other similar webapps.
